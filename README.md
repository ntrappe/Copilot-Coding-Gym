# Copilot-Coding-Gym

Welcome to Copilot Coding Gym! Just like a gym, but for your coding muscles! ðŸ’ª Here, we use the power of AI to generate a variety of workouts in the form of coding challenges, conceptual tests, and knowledge checks. Our aim is to help you flex and strengthen your core computer science skills in `C++`. Happy Coding!

## Data Structure Workouts
- **Array Aerobics:** Practice with contiguous memory allocation and constant-time access.
- **[Linked List Lunges](Data%20Structure%20Workouts/LinkedLists/linked-list.md):** Get dynamic with size and constant time insertion/deletion.
- **Stack Squats:** Feel the burn with LIFO behavior and function calls.
- **Queue Crunches:** Work on your FIFO behavior and breadth-first search.
- **Tree Pull-ups:** Climb the hierarchical structure used in file systems.
- **BST Hurdles:** Race through sorted data and logarithmic time operations.
- **Heap Deadlifts:** Lift with priority queues and heap sort.
- **Hash Table Hammer Curls:** Constant time operations will keep you on your toes.

## Algorithm Workouts
- **Sorting Sprints:** Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and more.
- **Searching Shuttle Runs:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and more.
- **Graph Climbing:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming Push-ups:** Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

## Conceptual Workouts
- **Big O Notation Jumping Jacks:** Analyze time and space complexity.
- **Recursion Relay Race:** Function calls itself as a subroutine.
- **Memory Management Marathon:** Understanding of stack and heap, garbage collection, etc.
- **Concurrency Crossfit:** Processes, threads, synchronization, deadlock, etc.
- **Networking Ninja Warrior:** TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP protocols, etc.

## Programming Workouts
- **Pass by Value vs Reference Planks:** A copy of the value or the memory address?
- **Inheritance Inclined Press:** Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes creating and maintaining an application much easier. Practice creating a base class and inheriting features in a derived class.
- **Polymorphism Planks:** Polymorphism allows routines to use variables of different types at different times. Get comfortable with function overloading and virtual functions.
- **Encapsulation Extensions:** Encapsulation binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data. Work on defining classes and creating objects.
- **Abstraction Abs Workout:** Abstraction hides the complex reality while showing the essential features. Practice creating abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- **STL (Standard Template Library) Squats:** STL is a powerful library in C++ consisting of template classes. Flex your coding muscles with containers, algorithms, and iterators.

## Software Design & Architecture Workouts
- **Design Patterns Dumbbell Curls:** Get familiar with common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator. These are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
- **MVC Treadmill:** Run through the Model-View-Controller pattern, commonly used for designing software that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
- **Microservices Mountain Climbers:** Climb through the design of software applications as suites of independently deployable services.
- **RESTful Rows:** Pull up on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) used in web service development.
- **OOP Overhead Press:** Press on the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- **Functional Programming Sit-ups:** Sit up and take notice of the principles of Functional Programming - Immutable data, first-class functions, and function composition and purity.

Remember, just like in a gym, consistency is key. Keep practicing these exercises regularly and youâ€™ll become a C++ heavyweight in no time!
